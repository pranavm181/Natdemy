# 📁 Folder Structure Guide

This document explains what each folder/file in the Flutter project does so you can quickly find the right place for changes.

---

## Root (`/`)

## Platform directories

| Folder | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `windows/`, `linux/` | Native runner projects generated by Flutter. Edit only when changing build settings or adding native plugins. |
| `web/` | Contains `index.html`, web manifest, icons, and CanvasKit/engine scripts. |

## How to extend

1. **Add a new API call** → create a service in `lib/api/`, model in `lib/data/`, update relevant screen.
2. **Add a new screen** → create in `lib/screens/`, reuse widgets from `lib/widgets/`.
3. **Persist data** → use SharedPreferences patterns in `auth_helper.dart` / `joined_courses.dart`.
4. **Add assets** → place under `assets/` and register in `pubspec.yaml`.
